! IMPORTANT ! Make sure NOT to change any of the file names, or delete/edit and of the file already here.
After the program is finished you can delete/move/rename any of the ".mp4" files but leave the others.

Step 1. Get 2 videos and make sure to name them "part01.mp4" and "part02.mp4", then put them in the main directory (where the other files are).
Step 2. Run the "Crasher.bat" file to get the output called "Crasher.mp4"
